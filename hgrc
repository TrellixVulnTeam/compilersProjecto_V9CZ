# This .hgrc is recommended for working on the Adblock Plus project.
#
# When using this as your .hgrc as-is, it provides a nicer user interface and
# enables some extensions that are useful for working on pretty much any
# project.
#
# The commented parts either do not work on all systems, are a matter of taste,
# or specific to the Adblock Plus project and might not make sense for everyone.
# Have a good look and decide for yourself what you want to enable.

## User interface controls
[ui]

# Sets your global user name. If you do not uncomment this, you will have to
# set it on a per-repository basis.
#username = Jane Doe <jdoe@example.com>

## Diff (i.e. patch) format configuration
[diff]

# We use Git's extended diff format which includes more information (such as
# changes to binary files).
git = true

# Makes diff output include eight lines of context.
unified = 8

## Defaults
#
# These change the default behaviour of common Mercurial commands.
[defaults]

# `hg log` shows the history of all branches by default, not just that of the
# current branch. The `--graph` option shows this as an ASCII tree and marks
# the revision you are currently at, which makes the history a lot easier to
# read.
log = --graph

# The "master" bookmark
#
# Most repositories of the Adblock Plus project use bookmarked branches to track
# multiple lines of development. The bookmark for the main line of development
# is, by convention, called "master".
#
# Unless you are working with Mercurial repositories that do not have a "master"
# bookmark, it is recommended that you uncomment the following defaults.

# `hg clone` updates to the latest changeset on the default branch. When working
# with repositories that have a "master" branch, you will want to update to that
# one instead, which you can do by adding `--updaterev master`. By uncommenting
# the following line, you won't have to worry about that. Note that when
# enabling this, you can still update to the latest changeset in the default
# branch by specifying `--updaterev default`.
#clone = --updaterev master

# `hg push` and `hg outgoing` will by default include all changesets, including
# bookmarked branches that you might want to just keep locally. To avoid this,
# you need to add `--rev master`. By uncommenting the following two lines, you
# won't have to worry about that. Note that when enabling this, you can still
# push any branch by specifying the `--rev` option.
#push = --rev master
#outgoing = --rev master

## Extensions
#
# Mercurial is, out of the box, fairly minimal. A lot of useful functionality
# comes as extensions. Most of the useful extensions are even part of the
# default Mercurial distribution, but not enabled by default.
[extensions]

# Progress extension, shows an ASCII progress bar for operations that take
# longer.
progress =

# Color extension, colors the output of commands like `hg log`. Enable it if
# your terminal supports colors (assuming you like colors).
#color =

# Pager extension, shows the output of commands like `hg log` in the terminal
# pager (e.g. less) configured below in the [pager] section.
#pager =

# Record extension, provides the `hg record` command that allows you to make
# partial commits.
record =

# Purge extension, provides the `hg purge` (aliased to `hg clean`) command that
# allows you to remove unversioned files.
purge =

# Rebase extension, provides the `hg rebase` command, see:
# https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension
rebase =

# Strip extension, provides the `hg strip` command that allows you to remove
# existing changesets.
strip =

# Histedit extension. Provides the `hg histedit` command that allows you to
# change and merge existing changesets, see:
# https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/HisteditExtension
histedit =

# Shelve extension, provides the `hg shelve` command that allows you to set
# pending changes aside, see:
# https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ShelveExtension
shelve =

# Review extension, provides the `hg review` command that makes it easier to
# upload reviews to codereview.adblockplus.org. You need to adjust the path
# so that it points to hgreview.py file in this repository.
#review = /path/to/codingtools/hgreview.py

# Configuration for the pager extension. This doesn't have any effect unless
# you enable the pager extension above.
[pager]
pager = LESS='FSRX' less
